OPENCV RECOGNITION PROJECTüì∏

This program was created to test, through a menu, the different recognition options offered by the OpenCV library.
The expected recognitions are:

- Emotion recognition
- Eye blink recognition
- Approximate age recognition (to be implemented)
- Eye tracking

----------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí•

The program needs a webcam to work, and above all, if started from the PyCharm IDE, the following libraries must be imported manually:
- cvzone
- deepface
- dlib

--------------------------------------
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE‚¨áÔ∏è

I am a 16 year old boy with a lot of experience in Python, in the last few months I have studied OpenCV and AI, so I have been quite fast in writing and solving bugs in the code, for this reason I have not stopped to leave explanatory comments within the program.

I am also doing a challenge with a friend of mine in which we have to, for a week, program as much as possible without breaks every day, and the most beautiful projects will win. The video will be out soon on Youtube!!

**Note**: The code was copied and pasted from another device of mine to allow full debugging, so the formatting of some functions may be off.
